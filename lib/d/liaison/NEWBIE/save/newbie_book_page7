The lands around the city can sometimes be strange and dangerous
places.  Through the northeastern (Least) gate is the path that goes
through the plains, some small villages, and finally up to the
mountains, also known as the Ramtops.

The southeastern (Hubwards) gate takes you into the vast forest where
innocent people are terrorised by wolves and other strange creatures
that roam unfettered.  It's also a more direct route to the Ramtops
(Carriages from Ankh-Morpork are a nice alternative to tired feet for
travelling to and from the towns in the Sto Plains and Ramtops)
Holywood is a great place for newbies venturing out of the city.  You
get there via the Brass Bridge.

The tour operator at Sator Square is ready to send you to the warm
and distant continent of Klatch, if you have enough money.

.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method returns the "determinate" short.  This function returns a
string that the message system replaces, when messages are printed, by the
determinate of the object (or "the" if the determinate is "a", "an" or
undefined) and its short as given by pretty_short. The string
should not be stored, since the object to which it refers may not later
exist; it can be processed with convert_message.


The return of this function needs more processing before the player sees it. In general you will not need to worry about this.

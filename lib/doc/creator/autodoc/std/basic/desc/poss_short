.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method returns the "possessed" short.  This function returns a
string that the message system replaces, when messages are printed, by a
string dependent on the possessor of the object and its short as
given by pretty_short. If the object has no environment or is not in a
living object or corpse, that string is the determinate. If the
environment of the object is the viewer of the message, that string
is "your". If the determinate is defined and is not "a " or "an ",
or, if it is not defined or is "a " or "an " but it is the only thing in its
environment with its plural, that string is the possessive of the owner, if
the owner has already been mentioned in constructing a sentence, or the
owner's the_short plus "'s "; otherwise, the string is "one
of the " plus the possessive bit as described in the previous part of
this sentence. Got all that? Good :) The string should not be stored,
since the object to which it refers may not later exist; it can be
processed with convert_message. Poss_short is mostly used for referring
to an object when a person has just used it to do something.


The return of this function needs more processing before the player sees it. In general you will not need to worry about this.

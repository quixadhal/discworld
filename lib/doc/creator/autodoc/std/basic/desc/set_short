.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method sets the short description for the object.  Be careful
with using function pointers here, as they do not save when
players log out.


The short description is the description seen in peoples inventorys and in brief mode when you enter rooms. This should be only a few words long and should contain a fairly good description of the object. Colour processing is done on basicly all of discworlds output, so that will work in the short.

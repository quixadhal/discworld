.SP 5 5

This method figures out how much an object will cost in a certain
place.  For instance at a shop that does not handle artifcacts an
artifact will be bought and sold cheaply.  The current types
of "artifact", "enchantment" and "material" are recognised.
A property in the shop of the type "artifact valued" will
cause the values of that type to be taken into account.

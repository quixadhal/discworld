.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This submits an effect event schedule.  It will call "function name" in your
effect object after the interval specified in interval_spec, with behaviour
modified by flags.  Addtional args may optionally be sent to "function name"
as well.  If none are passed, args == 0.
interval_spec can be one of:

.EP
.SP 5 5
n 
.EP
.SP 8 5
time in seconds 
.EP
.SP 5 5
({ m, n }) 
.EP
.SP 8 5
minimum time m seconds, maximum time n seconds, simple random distribution 
.EP
.SP 5 5
({ m, n, r }) 
.EP
.SP 8 5
as for the ({ m, n }) case, except the random factor is effectively "rolled" r times ... the higher r is, the more likely the interval is to be close to (m + n)/2.

flags may be:

EE_REMOVE 
.EP

These are defined in /include/effect.h 

Only one EE_REMOVE can be in place at a time. Subsequent EE_REMOVEs will wipe previous ones. 

NB: submit_ee can ONLY be called from the effect object itself in the course of a beginning/handler/end call, or from the effect shadow.

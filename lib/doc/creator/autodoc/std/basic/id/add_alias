.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method adds an alias to the object.   An alias for the object is the
part used as the main noun for the object. ie in the case of a "green
bath tub", "bathtub" might be an alias for the object. and "green"
and "bath" would be adjectives. The value set with add_alias is also
used with present. This means you can make up an alias for an object
that players cannot normaly access but you can
get a handle on with present. For an exmple of this look at the money
object.


The function takes an array or a string as an argument. If an array is passed in each element of the array is added to the alias array, if it is a string then the string elemnt is added to the array.

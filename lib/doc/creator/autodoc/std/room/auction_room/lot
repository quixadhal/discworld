lot -  A few notes about this class, I didn't like the way the old one worked, when a lot moved to expired_lots, there was no real way to recover it Instead, we will keep one array of all lots, with differing status's depending on whats happening.

A few notes about this class, I didn't like the way the old one
worked, when a lot moved to expired_lots, there was no real way to recover it
Instead, we will keep one array of all lots, with differing status's depending
on whats happening.
IE: Open: Accepting bids.
    Waiting: Seller: It did not take any acceptable bids and it is waiting collection
      by the seller.
    Waiting: Buyer: A bid was taken and we are waiting for payment.
    Waiting: Buyer (lapsed): A bid was taken, but lapsed. There are no 
      other bidders, so in the next cycle the seller will be mailed and
      status changed to Waiting: Seller.
    Waiting Creator Intervention:  A lot has fallen over in some way,
      and needs a creator to fix it.
    Closed: The bid has been collected (by either buyer or seller),
      lots will stay in this status for 2 hours after collection.
      Then payment will be credited to the payment array and the lot will 
      be deleted.
Case code is used in reference to the store class.
The rest are the same as they were in the last version

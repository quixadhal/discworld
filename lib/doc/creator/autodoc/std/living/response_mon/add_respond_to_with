.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method adds a respond message to respond to into the
current array of responses.


If response_mon_regexp is not set, the trigger consists of an array of words to be matched (in order) in the string. If there is an array instead of a single word at one point then any of the words in the array will be matched. If response_mon_regexp is set, the trigger is a single string, representing the regular expression to be matched in the string. 

The response is either an array of things to execute (in which case a random one will be chosen each time) or a function pointer or a string. If it is a string then the command of that name will be executed, if the string starts with a '#' then the function named after that will be called on the npc. That was exciting wasn't it? If the string has a $hname$ name in it and it is not a function call (starts with a #) then the $hname$ will be replaced with the name of the triggering object. $hcname$ or $short$ will be replaced with the short of the triggering object. 

In the case of a function call, two arguments are passed into the function: the first is the person which triggered the effect and the second in the message which triggered the effect. 

NOTE: The NPC must explicitly know the language being spoken, even if it's "common". I don't know why. That's just the way it is. See add_language().

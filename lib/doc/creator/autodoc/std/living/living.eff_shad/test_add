.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This method handles the cannot get flags.  This is placed
into the living object so that things which are marked as
being unable to be picked up can still be put into normal
containers.  The upwards checking of containers stops here.
This should make it so that objects marked as unable to be
picked up cannot be put into objects in the players
inventory.

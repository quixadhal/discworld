.SH Description
.SP 5 5

Read in a random name grammer from the data dir.   Any line with
# at the start is considered a comment, and anything after
a # on a line is ignored.   Every line in the file will have
3 fields seperated by a :.   The first field is the name
the second is a one letter expansion string, the third is a
a space separeted list of things to expand it to.


The word starts off as a "W", this is looked up in the expansion first string list. If it is found then that is expanded to a random selection of the space seperated data elements. This process is repeated until there are no bits in the word that can be expanded.

.SH Description
.SP 5 5

Used to determine if a player can identify a particular material.
The function returns the materials name or a string giving a rough
description if they're unable to identify it.

Some materials can be identified by being high enough at a particular skill
(defined in cmr.h) while others are only learned by being taught and others
are known to everyone.

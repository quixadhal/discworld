.SH Description
.SP 5 5

Adds an NPC to the list of NPC's who are to receive shout events.
The NPC need not be removed from this list when he dies -- desting
the NPC object has the same effect as calling npc_unhear_shouts().
event_person_shout() is activated on the NPC for all shouts.
NPC's do not normally detect shouts.
event_person_shout() on the NPC should be replaced with similar code 
to that in the broadcaster to determine if the shouter is within 
range and to generate the desired response.

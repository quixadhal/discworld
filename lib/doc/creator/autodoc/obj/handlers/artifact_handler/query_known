.SH Description
.SP 5 5

A person will not forget how to recognise an artifact (unless they
    refresh, in which case all of them are forgotten, i.e. the file
    is wiped) so to let a person learn to recognise an artifact, add
    a new line to their file consisting of its name and to see if
    they know an artifact, check in their file for its name. This
    method doesn't require a library handler.

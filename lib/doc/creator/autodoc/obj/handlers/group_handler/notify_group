.SH Description
.SP 5 5

This function broadcasts a message to the group's channel using
the broadcaster handler.  The first argument specifies the
group's name (not short), which also acts as the channel
name.  The second argument is the object doing the broadcasting.
The third argument varies.  It can either be a simple string,
in which case that string is printed as the message.  It can
also be a two-element string array.  The first element is
printed only to the object specified in the second argument.
The second element is printed to everyone else.

This is a very powerful command and one of the most useful debug commands.  The function name is fairly explanitory, it is something like \"short\" or \"long\".  If the obvar assignment is used and the result of the call is an object pointer, then the obvar specified will now point to that object.  The args are very flexible and I will now give you a description of all the forms that the arguments to the functions can take.  Of course all object references are done through wiz_present.Numbers are of course passed as numbers, bet that surprised you :)  Strings can take a number of forms.  Any of ', \" or ` can be used to mark the start and end of strings, it will match the two sorts of string ends. So if you wish to have a ' in your string you can use \"'s to include it. ie \"thieves' cant\".  If the text is surrounded by |'s the args inside is passed directly to wiz_present and will error if it cannot find an object to match.  {}'s mean arrays.  So {1, 2, 3} is a array of size 3 containing the elements 1, 2, 3.  Anything of the form ob->func(args) is replaced with the return value of the function.The default parseing of a paramater (if it is not specificaly specified) is to try and see if it is an object.  If this is the case it is replaced with this, if not it is taken as a string.Object values and return values from function calls.  If there is only one matching object a single object is returned.  If more than one object matches it is replaced with the array of objects.  The same applies to return values from functions.In summary: ",6,({3,17,-25,}),({"","","","","","","","",}),({"<num>","'<anything>'","\"<anythinng>\"","`<anything>`","{args}","ob->func(args)","|<text>|","<default>",}),({"A number","A string","A string","A string","An array conatining args. eg { 1, \"bing\", { 'yellow' } }","Calls function func on object ob. eg labels->short()","Replaced with objects.  eg all in pinkfish","The default text is first checked to see if it is a object, if it is it is replaced with the object, otherwise it is taken as a string.",}),"Examples",7,5,"> call adjust_money(1, \"gold\") me<Return thingy printed here>> ;me->adjust_money(1, \"gold\");({ -- sizeof 1   0})","See also",7,5,"wiz_present, object.","",})

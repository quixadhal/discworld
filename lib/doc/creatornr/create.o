Keep in mind that each of the commands listed in eachof the files has its own help file in turn, accessible via 'help'.  So'help goto' will return the help file on the command 'goto'.  All helpfiles as well as all kinds of lengthier documentation are located in/doc.  Read through /doc for further information.",})

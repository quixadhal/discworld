map_delete() - remove a (key, value) pair from a mapping based on the key

Synopsis

void
map_delete(mapping m, mixed element)

Description
.SP 5 5
map_delete removes the (key, value) from the mapping m that has key equal
to element.

For example, given:

   mapping names;

   names = ([]);
   names["truilkan"] = "john";
   names["wayfarer"] = "erik";
   names["jacques"] = "dwayne";

Then:

   map_delete(names,"truilkan");

causes the mapping 'names' to be equal to:

  (["wayfarer" : "erik", "jacques" : "dwayne"])

keys(names) will not contain "truilkan" after map_delete(names,"truilkan")
is called [unless ("truilkan", *) is subsequently added back to the mapping].

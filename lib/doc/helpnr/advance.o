This is how you increase your ability at certain skills.  Horriblely useful command and I am not sure how to write this.  Well, we shall see how it turns out.  Please direct all critism to whoever happens to be on at the time.  You can advance your skills by a certain number of levels or to a certain level (assumeing you have the xp of course).  If you do not specify which level you are adavanceing to or a number to advance by, it assumes you are advanceing by 1 level.  To specify advanceing different skills down the heiracy you seperate the things by .'s.  So fighting.points or fighting.melee.combat.sharp. You can also go for the best match.  So f.p will work too.  Hope this doesn't confuse you too much.  You can advance in any guild up to 5th level in all skills.  At this point (or before) you must make a descision about which guild to join.
